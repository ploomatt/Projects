Description:
>This project involves creating visualizations to explore a dataset of eCommerce activity from various regions around the world in 2011. The purpose is to analyze global trends, purchasing behaviors, and sales performance over the course of the year. By visualizing key metrics such as sales volume, customer demographics, and regional activity, the project aims to uncover insights into how different markets contributed to the overall eCommerce landscape.
